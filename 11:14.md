YOU GOT A FRIEND INSIDE ME
YOU GOT A FRIEND INSIDE ME

WHEN THE ROAD LOOKS ROUGH AHEAD
AND YOU'RE MILES AND MILES FROM YOUR WARM COLD BED
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING I WOULDN'T DO FOR YOU
YOU JUST REMEMBER WHAT YOUR OLD PAL'D DO

BOY YOU GOT A FRIEND INSIDE ME

YOU GOT A FRIEND INSIDE ME
YOU GOT YOUR TROUBLES
I GOT EM TOO
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING I WOULDN'T DO FOR YOU
WE STICK TOGETHER AND WE'LL SEE IT THROUGH
CAUSE YOU GOT A FRIEND INSIDE ME

YOU GOT A FRIEND INSIDE ME

SOME OTHER FOLKS MIGHT A LITTLE BIT SMARTER THAN I AM
BIGGER AND STRONGER TOO
(MAYBE)
BUT NONE OF THEM
WILL EVER LOVE YOU

IT'S ME AND YOU BOY

AND AS THE YEARS GO BY
I WILL NEVER DIE

YOU GONNA SEE IT'S OUR DESTINY

YOU GOT A FRIEND INSIDE ME
YOU GOT A FRIEND INSIDE ME
YOU GOT A FRIEND INSIDE ME
YOU GOT A FRIEND INSIDE ME
